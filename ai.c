The Dispose method is primarily implemented to release unmanaged resources.
When working with instance members that are IDisposable implementations, it's common to cascade Dispose calls.
There are other reasons for implementing Dispose, for example, to free memory that was allocated,
remove an item that was added to a collection, or signal the release of a lock that was acquired.
